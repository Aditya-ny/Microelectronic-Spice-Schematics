# Microelectronic-Spice-Schematics

These files are the LTSpice schematics of my created designs. All the files work as required and are verified by my professor
Dr. Loomis of the University of Dayton.
I can also provide you the required outputs.

I also included my Project/Assignment report files. Each pdf contains all the work done by me in 2 weeks. 
I love to work on digital circuits.
